# Human_Activity_Recognition
In this project, we elaborate on human activity recognition tracked by the shoe insoles that have several sensors on them. The project's objective is to find out the most significant features, through transformation and elimination of the non-important features, and build a model with high accuracy to track the human movement. The dataset is provided by an Armenian start-up company, Embry Tech, that has collected the data among several people. The methods used in the model building process are Correlation Analysis, Binary Logistic Regression, CART Decision Tree, and  Random Forest. The findings illustrate a better predictive power and accuracy for Random Forest.
